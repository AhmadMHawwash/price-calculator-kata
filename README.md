## Invitation
You are invited to implement imaginary customer’s requirements listed below, using programming language of choice and applying any coding practices you wish.

I have been using this example since 2016 in trainings and lectures. Many developers have already passed through the drill of implementing these same requirements.

## Rules of Conduct
**1. You are free to choose programming language and programming method** - This challenge is not a competition. There are no better or worse solutions per se. The goal is to evaluate expressiveness of languages and usefulness of programming paradigms. All languages and paradigms are equally welcome.

**2. Requirements should be implemented in order** - The sequence of requirements is simulating the evolution of customer's expectations over a prolonged period of time, as customer occasionally gets “bright ideas” and hands them over to developers. Implementing requirements all at once or out of order would look like real time was flowing back and forth.

**3. Application must be operative at all times** - After implementing each requirement, the application must be correct and fully operational. The newly implemented requirement, as well as all previous requirements must work. If, however, there are bugs or omissions, don’t despair – just apply a fix when you find them and carry on. That is what you would do in a day-to-day development anyway.

**4. Mark each task with the requirement label** - Include requirement label into each commit message, so that the evolution of the product can be observed later. Each requirement begins with a label in capital letters.

**5. Pretend you don’t know the requirements in advance** - Even though you can read all the requirements right away, try thinking of those beyond the one you’re currently solving as yet unknown. Don’t overengineer current solution because you have anticipated a future requirement.
